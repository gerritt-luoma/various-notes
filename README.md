# various-notes
This is a repository where I will store random notes that I am going to take while working on personal projects.

I am currently working on familiarizing myself with javascript which I will be using for the front end of a football webapp that I am working on.  The javascript notes will be starting from the very basics since I haven't touched it in years.  In the future I am planning on adding some react/node notes, python notes, CSS notes, and HTML notes.
