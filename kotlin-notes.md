# Kotlin notes
I have very little kotlin experience at the time of writing this.  I will be following [codecademy's kotlin course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-kotlin) while writing these notets.  Due to experience with other languages this might not be fully detailed.
## Why to learn kotlin
- Compatible with java
- Concise syntax with additional safety features
- Google's preferred android development language
