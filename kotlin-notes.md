# Kotlin notes
I have very little kotlin experience at the time of writing this.  I will be following [codecademy's kotlin course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-kotlin) while writing these notets.  Due to experience with other languages this might not be fully detailed.
## Why to learn kotlin
- Compatible with java
- Concise syntax with additional safety features
- Google's preferred android development language

## Kotlin basics
- Kotlin requires a main function to run
  - Without a main function the program will throw an error because it won't know where to start 
- Similar to JavaScript, semicolons are optional in Kotlin
- You can print text to the console through the `println(<expression>)` command
  - There is also the `print(<expression>)` command which does the same thing as `println` without adding a new line at the end
- When Kotlin is ran it is compiled to machine code that can be read by the `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)`  which then handles the execution of the code
- You can write comments using the same syntax as JavaScript or C with single line comments being `//` and multi line comments being `/* */`
